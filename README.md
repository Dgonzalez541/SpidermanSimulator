#Spiderman Simulator
This game was a my final project for my Immersive Media (Virtual Reality) class. The player can manually climb walls using controllers, and shoot webs that attach to objects in order to swing from place to place. The player also has the ability to enable a birdcage system that places a static cage with see-through bars over their head to reduce motion sickness. This provides a static reference frame that reduced or even eliminated motion sickness in several testers. This project was showcased at the 2018 CISCO conference in Jackson, MS.

IMPORTANT Run on version 2017.3 or .4
